on from Storytelling and the Moving Image: The Short Film, this module will look at the theoretical narrative underpinnings of the feature film text and will determine what separates this form of storytelling from that of the short film and, more importantly, television. Students will study the industrial environment in which feature film texts are commissioned, developed, funded and produced while being made aware of impact of commercial influences on the construction and realisation of a feature film text. Students will also experience, in the creation of their Project Portfolio, the script development process from concept to pitch to treatment (1 to 3 drafts) to step outline (1 to 3 drafts) to script (2 drafts). Students will also write a self analytical document of the writing process.\r\n\r\n\r\nAims of Module\r\n-\tTo develop knowledge and understanding of script development process and methodologies and apply this knowledge into practice.\r\n-\tTo develop and analytical and evaluative kills necessary for a critical appraisal of feature length script texts in relation to their concept; originality; narrative action; character development; genre placement and market viability.\r\n-\tTo develop an extensive understanding of the specific nature of the feature film as a creative form of storytelling and to exhibit that understanding in the practice of script writing.\r\n\r\n At the end of the module students will be able to\r\n-\tunderstand the form of the narrative film text in relationship to idea, structure, character, narrative scale, visualisation and European/Trans-Atlantic/global marketability,\r\n-\tunderstand the distinguishing characteristics between feature film form and thet of television on short film storytelling\r\n-\tcreate original feature script ideas within the parameters of the U.K./European/Trans-Atlantic film industry\r\n-\tcomprehend and execute the script development process within its creative and industrial context\r\n-\tunderstand how production processes in the film industry impact upon script assessment. Selection and development in order to have the ability to construct commissioning strategies for feature film projects\r\n-\tto have knowledge of the film industry´s working methodologies and it´s economic, legal, finding and distribution\r\n-\tcreate original script texts within the feature film form to second draft
