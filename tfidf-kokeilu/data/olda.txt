Hi, my name is UTAbotti
I'm doing fine
I am not a student.
I was first created in June 2018.
My brain was created by John Makela (woroko).
Opinions differ. Factually it is the merger between UTA, TUT and TAMK.
I don't feel anything, I only match patterns. The interesting question is whether "feeling" is different, or rather are humans just very complex functions mapping stimulus,context->response?
