# TUNIBot
Project Work 2018F - TUNI chatbot

This is the public repository for the TUNIBot project.

To use, you will need to install all the requirements (Rasa, ChatScript, Program-Y)

Before launching the main app (TUNIBrain/app.py), you will need to train the Rasa 
model, build the ChatScript bot (TUNIBOTTI), and launch all the relevant supporting 
servers. 

There is an example start script in the TUNIBrain directory.
